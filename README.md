TexEdit is a GUI application written in C# with Avalonia. It aims to help the process of writing TeX documents by providing the ability to edit,
compile and view the document in one window.

> **Warning**: TexEdit is by and large a **personal project**, so it *may* change at any time, without warning.

**All contributions to this project are welcome!** For more information, see the [project TO-DO list](https://trello.com/b/j7j6h7q8/texedit-todo).
